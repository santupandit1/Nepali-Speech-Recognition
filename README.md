# Nepali-Speech-Recognition
üó£Ô∏è Nepali Speech Recognition System
This project focuses on developing a speech recognition system for the Nepali language using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The system is powered by wav2vec 2.0, a cutting-edge architecture from Facebook AI, which enables accurate transcription of Nepali spoken language into text.

üöÄ Key Features
State-of-the-art Model (wav2vec 2.0): Leveraged the powerful transformer-based wav2vec 2.0 architecture for robust and accurate speech-to-text conversion in Nepali.

Preprocessing & Training: Extensively cleaned and prepared a large dataset of Nepali speech recordings. Performed training using PyTorch and HuggingFace's transformers library.

Accessibility-Oriented: Designed to help users with physical disabilities, and support voice-based interaction for Nepali language learners via voice commands, dictation, and real-time transcription.

Inclusive Communication: Promotes better interaction within Nepali-speaking communities by making voice-driven interfaces available in the native language.

üß† Technical Stack
